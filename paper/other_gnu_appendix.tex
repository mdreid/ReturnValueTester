\section{Other Utility Crashes}
\label{appendix:other_gnu}

\texttt{grep}, which allows for regular expression search, crashed when \texttt{calloc} returned \texttt{NULL}. The error was buried deep in the call stack, but was due to a failure to check the return value from \texttt{hash\_initialize}, which initializes a hash table and returns a pointer to it (or \texttt{NULL} in the case that it fails). The fix is given in Listing \ref{lst:exclude.c}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:exclude.c},firstnumber=265, caption={\texttt{lib/exclude.c}.}, language=C]
	case exclude_hash:
	  sp->v.table = hash_initialize (0, NULL,
	                                 (options & FNM_CASEFOLD) ?
	                                   string_hasher_ci
	                                   : string_hasher,
	                                 (options & FNM_CASEFOLD) ?
	                                   string_compare_ci
	                                   : string_compare,
	                                 string_free);
+	  if (!sp->v.table)
+	    abort();
