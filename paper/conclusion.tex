We investigated the robustness of Linux applications using a fuzz testing paradigm. We developed a mechanism to control the value returned to applications from various system and library calls. Using LD\_PRELOAD we were able to intercept calls and force an error value to be returned to the calling application. In this way we could analyze how well-handled these error conditions were. We divided our testing suite loosely between small and large-scale applications. We found that of the 88 applications we tested, 31 crashed for at least one of the 22 calls we fuzzed.
