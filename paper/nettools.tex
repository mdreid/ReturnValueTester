\subsection{\texttt{net-tools}}
The \texttt{net-tools} suite includes a number of small utilities that form the base of the networking distribution for Linux \cite{nettools}. We hypothesized that \texttt{net-tools} would also yield a significant number of crashes, as some of the utilities in it have been deprecated in favor of the \texttt{ip} utility. We tested 11 utilities and found that 5 (45.5 \%) crashed (listing \ref{lst:net-tools}. \texttt{malloc} was the source of all  the crashes. A more detailed investigation into the root cause of some of these crashes is given in appendix \ref{appendix:net-tools}.
