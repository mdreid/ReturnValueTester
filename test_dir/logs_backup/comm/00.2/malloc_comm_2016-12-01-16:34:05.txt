	Best wishes for the Thanksgiving break.
	My 638/838 classes are now in the reg system, but not yet open.  It turns out that a 'meets with' pairing of classes requires a paper form to be submitted by the CS Dept to the Curriculum Services Office.  That form has been submitted by CS.  Once that form is approved, which I am guessing will not occur until next week, the course will open.  
	The reg page also says 'consent of instructor,' which is the default for cs638 and cs838, but you will NOT need my consent to sign up once the course does open.
	This is a followup note about the Deep Neural Networks class I announced a few days ago.  If you're not interested in that class, no need to read further.
