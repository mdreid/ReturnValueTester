\section{Introduction}
Nearly every function from commonly used C libraries returns some value. In most cases, these values indicate something that is relevant to the  functions operations, such as a file descriptor, number of bytes processed, or a pointer to some data. Additionally, most functions can return some predefined value that indicates that an error occurred during the function's execution. Unfortunately, many programmers have the bad habit of not checking these return values for such error conditions. In our work, we plan to analysis a suite of commonly used Linux applications and see if any do not correctly handle errors returned by commonly used system/library calls.

\section{Motivation}
In their paper (cite), Miller et al. modified the \texttt{malloc} library function to return \texttt{NULL} with some probability indicting that memory allocation has failed. They then tested a variety of Linux utilities using this this version of \texttt{malloc} to test if they correctly handled this error case. Surprisingly, the majority of these utilities did not correctly handle this case and crashed in a variety of ways. We plan to expand on this idea and test significantly more system/library calls in a similar way.
